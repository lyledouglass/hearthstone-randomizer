# Hearthstone-Randomizer

This World of Warcraft addon creates a macro that dynamically randomizes your hearthstone toys, selecting a new one each time so you're always surprised which one you use! This addon is a fork of the `random-hearthstone-toy` (see credits below). It has been updated to create a macro rather than using a hidden button, and has been updated to include newer hearthstone toys as well as the removal of Convenant specific restrictions that were outdated.

## Usage

After installing the addon and loading up World of Warcraft, a new macro will be created in your macro list called "RHT". This macro will automatically randomize a hearthstone toy. After clicking the macro, it will select a different random hearthstone toy from your inventory and update the macro to use that one instead.

## Installation

This addon is not yet available on CurseForge, so you'll need to install it manually, or via the Github link installer on the WoWUp installer. To install manually, download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/lyledouglass/hearthstone-randomizer/releases) and extract the contents to your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` folder.

To install via WoWUp, click the "Install from URL" button and paste the following URL: `https://github.com/lyledouglass/hearthstone-randomizer`

## Credits

This addon was forked from the `random-hearthstone-toy` addon created by Hemco under the MIT license. The original addon can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/random-hearthstone-toy```).
