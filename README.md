# Hearthstone-Randomizer

This World of Warcraft addon creates a macro that dynamically randomizes your hearthstone toys, selecting a new one each time so you're always surprised which one you use! This addon started as a fork of the `random-hearthstone-toy` (see credits below). It has been updated and refactored completely for Midnight!

## Usage

After installing the addon and loading up World of Warcraft, a new macro will be created in your macro list called "RandomHeath". This macro will automatically randomize a hearthstone toy. After clicking the macro, it will select a different random hearthstone toy from your inventory and update the macro to use that one instead.

If you find that a specific hearthstone toy is missing, please submit an issue via Github. I try to keep up with all the new changes but some may get missed!
